# Overview 
## Description
Locates areas for the optimal dining and studying experience based on ratings from UB students.

## App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Will include real-time map data and ratings from users based on their experience at different places, and also allows users to find the nearest hotspot based on where they are
- **Story:** As students, many of us find ourselves walking around campus all day, but often to no avail when we can't decide where to go. An area might be too busy, too loud, or closed at the time, so this app would allow users to analyze the area before they go, saving them valuable time and energy
- **Market:** All UB students, staff, faculty, and visitors could use this app to find what they need, regardless of their age or academic departments
- **Habit:** This app would be used by a given user almost every day if they find value in the ratings on the app, and could potentially be used multiple times in a day if the user needs different ratings at different times
- **Scope:** This app is, from a technical perspective, fairly challenging to build since it relies heavily on user input and location data, but it is clearly defined and a stripped-down version of it is still interesting to build
